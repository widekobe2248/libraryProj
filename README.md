# libraryProj

This is the repo for our Library Management System
It will use PHP, HTML, MySQL, Javascript, and CSS

It will mock a simple library management system which allow us too...

- Adding, editing, removing library members (including staff members) – this is
done by a library manager.
- Adding, editing and removing books, copies – the library manager is responsible
for this.
- Borrowing and returning books – a library assistant is in charge of these
operations.
- Browsing through the system to search for certain books.
- Authenticate the library manager and the library assistant.
